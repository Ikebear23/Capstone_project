Logging in! Next steps ... 
[ ] Pull in all users when app initially loads 
[ ] Match user that is logging in to the correct user (stored in state)
[ ] In order to persist being logged in (when you refresh the page, you want the current user to stay logged in), it would be a good idea to store the token and/or user information in localStorage [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API). This will also help with the persistant cart requirement. 
(Left comment in Navbar.jsx as well w/more specific suggestion)
[ ] Since you already have the register API method, adding a registration form would be a good next step.
